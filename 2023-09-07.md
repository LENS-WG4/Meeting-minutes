# Summary 

## OSCARS and opportunities for getting funding for EOSC / FAIR data activities (Andy Götz)

Andy gave a presentation about OSCARS that is available from [ERSF cloud](https://cloud.esrf.fr/s/by5jrJpFLJsKy46)
The OSCARS project has been granted 25 M€ from the E.C. of which 18 M€ will be spent on cascading grants that can be applied for through open calls. 
The project is led by CNRS Annecy but all EOSC science clusters are represented with 21 partners in total. PaNOSC is represented by DESY and ERSF. CERIC is responsible  for the communication wp. 
The project will run for 4 years beginning Jan. 1, 2024 and with frist call in March 2024 followed by one in November 2024.
Intercross projects will be favored. 

It is unclear if ISIS + PSI can participate. However, it had been announced that UK will join Horizon Europe from Jan 1, 2024 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_4373) so it may well be possible that ISIS can apply for the cascading grants. 

THR encouraged the LENS members to apply for funding to clean up their data (enrich them with meta data), because currently filters on https://data.panosc.eu return nothing. As an example, filtering on SANS returns nothing, whereas searching on SANS in the text field returns a number of matches (The option to filter is consequently hidden for now). 

The project is looking for reviewers of the cascading grants. 


## WG4 presentation for LENS anniversary meeting Sept 12th 
THR had been tasked with presenting successes at the LENS 5 years anniversary celebration meeting in Lund Sept 12. A number of achievements were discussed and THR subsequently received list of events from MG and SM. (The presentation can be found in the [Presentations repository](https://github.com/LENS-WG4/Presentations/) 

Other things were discussed:

AA mentioned that DAPHNE works on logbook for virtual experiments. This should work next summer, but it should be possible to present product by end of year. DAPHNE is using SciCat just like ESS and PSI. DAPHNE, PSI, and ESS use SciCat as metadata catalogue

There will be another AI workshop at FZJ in April 2024 - an activity of the AI subgroup

MDANSE summer school will be organized again next year - an acitivity of the Atomistic Simulations subgroup. 



## Benchmarking data requested by LENS management

LENS management has asked WG4 to provide benchmarking data that can used for e.g. machine learning, validating models, etc. 

SM and GM said that they may have data that if enriched could be used for this purpose

The use of simulated data for this purpose was also discussed and THR mentioned that he would like to upload data from a FZJ/ESS/DTU post doc project to SciCat. In this project simulations were performed for all models in the SasView library. 

NOMAD was also discussed. 

## Other updates and activities (MDANSE, data analysis workshop, etc)

THR mentioned that ESS is currently running a summer school about the ESS software suite to be used by future users and FAIR data. More information can be found on [the associated indico page](https://indico.esss.lu.se/event/3267/)
