# Summary 

## OSCARS and opportunities for getting funding for EOSC / FAIR data activities (Andy Götz)

Andy gave a presentation about OSCARS that is available from [ERSF cloud](https://cloud.esrf.fr/s/by5jrJpFLJsKy46)
The OSCARS project has been granted 25 M€ from the E.C. of which 18 M€ will be spent on cascading grants that can be applied for through open calls. 
The project is led by CNRS Annecy but all EOSC science clusters are represented with 21 partners in total. PaNOSC is represented by DESY and ERSF. CERIC is responsible  for the communication wp. 
The project will run for 4 years beginning Jan. 1, 2024 and with frist call in March 2024 followed by one in November 2024.
Intercross projects will be favored. 

It is unclear if ISIS + PSI can participate. However, it had been announced that UK will join Horizon Europe from Jan 1, 2024 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_4373) so it may well be possible that ISIS can apply for the cascading grants. 

THR encouraged the LENS members to apply for funding to clean up their data (enrich them with meta data), because currently filters on https://data.panosc.eu return nothing. As an example, filtering on SANS returns nothing, whereas searching on SANS in the text field returns a number of matches (The option to filter is consequently hidden for now). 

The project is looking for reviewers of the cascading grants. 


## WG4 presentation for LENS anniversary meeting Sept 12th 
THR had been tasked with presenting successes at the LENS 5 years anniversary celebration meeting in Lund Sept 12. A number of achievements were discussed and THR subsequently received list of events from some MG and SM. (The presentation can be found in the [Presentations repository](https://github.com/LENS-WG4/Presentations/)
