# Summary:

# Attendance to the NOBUGS meeting – mandatory in person meeting for LENS members

It has been discussed that LENS members should meet in person. 

The NOBUGS conference will take place in Grenoble at the end of September, Monday the 23rd to Friday the 27th. NOBUGS is preparing a visual timetable so people can see if they can participate and what workshops they can attend.

There will be satellite meetings before and after the conference. There will be a satellite meeting with all the LENS members on Friday the 27th of September. 

PM suggested that some work should be done in preparation to that, an agenda and maybe a workshop. He also mentioned that we should choose and focus only on one topic. 

It has been discussed that the initial scope of the meeting was to focus on data analysis. It has been suggested to keep this scope or find a new one to which everyone can contribute. 

AM commented that the data analysis topic is huge so we should focus on 2-3 topics maximum, on which there are existing collaborations. 

PM suggested that from now until September we should come up with suggestions for topics. 

PM suggested that we should investigate who is willing to participate. If no one can’t attend, then there is no point in holding the workshop. 


# Continue the discussion about the FAIR data – for data analysis/machine learning 

PM suggested that we should set-up concrete action, with more focus on the neutron community; that we should find a common way for the data to be fair.

It has been mentioned that there are still instruments which are not writing fair data.

AA suggested a survey to get an overview of where people are. 

FB mentioned that the previous survey was not clear about the fairness but more about the numbers. We might need to recreate the previous survey. 

Where can we find these forms? 

AM questioned if it is realistic do to this before NOBUGS.

PM added that it is not necessary to do it before NOBUGS but it can be discussed more on how to organize this type of activity.
PM raised the question: “What is the goal?”. The action could be a LENS action, at the level of a single lab, but in agreement with all the others, where everyone puts in some resources. 

AA suggested not having too many questions in the survey. 

AM suggested that this could be a discussion point for the meeting on the 27th of September. If this is what we agree on, then we can come prepared to the meeting. 


# Summary:
* ??? to organize a doodle/calendar invite to see if we have enough participants for the 27th
* The meeting could be hybrid but the LENS core should meet in person
* We need to discuss about the concrete action on fair data
* We need to send out a survey to see what is the status and promote some action to be discussed at the meeting on the 27th 
* If we are planning on going to the meeting, we need to come up with 2-3 fair data analyses to discuss and promote some concrete action as well
