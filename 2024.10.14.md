# Discussions:

### PM (Paolo Mutti)
- Suggested starting AI-related activities by combining individual data (experimental and simulation) to reach a critical mass.
- Noted the **format discussion** is endless, but no conclusion has been reached yet.
- Suggested to **upload all available data**, as the format can be adjusted later.
- Gave the team **a month** to begin uploading data to the **50 GB storage**, with a need for **clear action points** between meetings.
- Confirmed that **nobody else from ILL** besides PM will be uploading data for now. Proposed to keep data sharing **within the group** for the time being.

### AM (Anders Markvardsen)
- Tried to upload a dataset, and asked for clarification on the **"contact person"** role (whether it refers to someone available for a certain period).
- Suggested uploading a **different type of file** that might include relevant information.
- Asked whether it was necessary for the data to have already been **published**.
- Inquired if **MG gets notifications** when data is uploaded, and how she would know who uploaded it.

### MG (Marina Ganeva)
- Recommended to **archive datasets** before uploading (any type of file format is acceptable).
- Mentioned that since no data has been uploaded yet, it's unclear how notifications will work.
- Confirmed that data uploads are **anonymous**, so it’s important to note **who the data is from** or which **institution** it belongs to.
- **MG** will test the system by uploading her **post-doc data**.
- Can provide a **password-protected link** for uploads, but the current link is either **public/private** (needs clarification).

### THR (Thomas Holm Rod)
- Agreed to focus on **SANS and Reflectometry** at this stage.
- Raised the idea of reaching out to the **reflectometry community**, but MG advised against it due to potential bureaucracy.
- Noted that the **biggest request at ESS** is currently from the **diffraction community**.

## 2. Action Points

- **MG** to upload her **post-doc data** to test the system.
